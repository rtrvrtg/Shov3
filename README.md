# Shov3

An experimental JavaScript library for putting files on S3-compatible file 
stores.

Developed by Geoffrey Roberts  
[g.roberts@blackicemedia.com](mailto:g.roberts@blackicemedia.com)

Created at a hackfest run by Anchor Systems on 18-19th January 2013  
[http://www.anchor.com.au](http://www.anchor.com.au)

## Libraries Used

* jQuery
* Base64
* SHA
* jQuery MD5 plugin

## Requirements

Your S3-compatible file store must support CORS.

## Usage

Check out the examples directory, I put together a couple of examples.

## Notes

This is still pretty rough and possibly insecure so you probably don't want to 
use this in production code just yet.

This should be compatible with any S3-compatible file store, just change the 
endpoint in Shove3Prefs.

Some of my examples also feature GeoSnappy, a little library I wrote for 
taking photos from webcams while recording geolocation coordinates.
